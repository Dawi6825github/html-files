	<h2 style="">Vacuum Tube</h2>
	<p>Alternatively called an electron tube or valve and first developed by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904. The vacuum tube is a glass tube with its gas removed, creating a vacuum. Vacuum tubes contain electrodes for controlling electron flow and were used in early computers as a switch or an amplifier.
	Alternatively called an electron tube or valve and first developed by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904. The vacuum tube is a glass tube with its gas removed, creating a vacuum. Vacuum tubes contain electrodes for controlling electron flow and were used in early computers as a switch or an amplifier. The picture shows a collection of different vacuum tubes used with different devices.

By using vacuum tubes instead of mechanical relays, computers could move away from mechanical switching and speed up switching on and off the flow of electrons. Vacuum tubes were also used in radios, televisions, radar equipment, and telephone systems during the first half of the 1900s.

In the 1950s, the invention of the transistor started to replace the vacuum tube, as vacuum tubes were larger, fragile like a light bulb, and expensive. As computing devices started to become smaller in size, transistors were more ideal to use due to their smaller size.
Today, vacuum tubes are primarily used in high-end audio equipment, preferred by some audiophiles as an alternative to digital systems.</p>

	<h2>Evolution of Sensors</h2>
	<p>    -&gt; First Generation Devices: Beginning stage of sensors, Devices made of Limited Electronics with MEMS sensor Element, Sometimes used with Micro Chips with analog amplification Circuit in it. MEMS means Micro-Electro-Mechanical systems some time known as Microelectronic and MicroElectromechanical systems.MEMS are made up of component size between 1 to 100 micrometers and MEMS based devices size range from 20 micrometers to 1 millimetres.
<br>
-&gt;Second Generation sensors: The second Stage of Sensor MEMS Sensor element along with Analog signal amplification and Analog to Digital convertor on a single microchip.<br>
-&gt;Third generation sensors: the third generation Sensors included MEMS element, analog amplification, and analog to Digital conversion with Digital intelligence for Linearization and temperature compensation on same micro chip.<br>
-&gt;Fourth Generation Sensors: to perform Calibration and Temperature compensation Data Processing, The Memory cells was necessary, so the Memory cells added to Third generation sensors and the new one known as fourth generation sensors.Sensors have existed for longer than the internet has, and much longer than the Internet of Things (IoT). Once upon a time, canaries sensed danger and martyred themselves in coal-mines. Now drones do sensing in hurricanes and droids do it in nuclear reactors.

While at the sensor conference in San Francisco this year, I was struck by the realization that most of the companies participating have been building sensor technology for decades, pre-dating IoT. Connectivity to the cloud seems to have given sensors a new lease of life.

Since sensors are an essential component of IoT applications, here is a quick look at the evolution of sensors of all shapes and sizes and across industries; from the days of canaries to the age of drones.</p>

<h2>ARM</h2>
<p style="display: inline-flex;"> ARM stands for Advanced RISC Machine. ARM architectures represent a different approach to how the hardware for a system is designed when compared to more familiar server architectures like x86.
	Modern examples of Arm-based processors include Nvidia’s Tegra chip found inside the Nintendo Switch, and the new Apple Silicon processors for Macs and MacBooks. One of Arm Limited’s biggest client is Qualcomm, using the architecture to develop Snapdragon processors that power the vast majority of modern smartphones and tablets. In fact, if you have a small portable computing device, there’s a good chance it’s running on Arm architecture.
	Arm is a RISC (reduced instruction set computing) architecture developed by the company Arm Limited. This processor architecture is nothing new. It was first used in personal computers as far back as the 1980s.

However, you’re unlikely to see a device labelled as featuring an ‘Arm’ processor like you do with AMD and Intel powered machines. That’s because Arm Limited licenses the architecture to third-party companies so they can develop their own custom-made processors.
